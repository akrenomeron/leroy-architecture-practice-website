        <span>First, we set up a meeting at anyplace you want or we can do it online. We talk about what you are interested in, and if we are able to do your dream project we will gladly help you. Once we have out meeting we will start planning. We will set up another meeting to talk about where you plan the location to be and what you expect within the house. We will then start the blueprint.
         Once we the blueprint is all set up, we will set up another meeting. This meeting is for you to geet your opinion on the blueprint, and once it has edits and your approval we will then start on a 3D overview. This will help you get a better understanding of your building. If you would like we can have another meeting with a local construction worker, and get their perspective.
         Once everthing has been approved by you, we can get started on your lovely new home!
